# Sudoku Playground #Ô∏è‚É£  (work-in-progress sample üë∑)

**This is not an official Google product**

Sudoku Playground is a **work-in-progress** sudoku game app for Android and Web (JS).

It's a hobby project to learn about Android APIs, libraries and best practices. It contains a
functional sudoku board generator and solver, as well as UI so that you can actually play a
sudoku board from start to finish. 

At the same time, this app is not meant to showcase the best-in-class sudoku algorithms - 
the ones implemented are _good enough_ for this sample.

## Android development

Some tech you can find inside:

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * The sudoku generator/solver is a pure kotlin common module, included from the Android
 and JavaScript modules
 * Uses [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/):
 ViewModels and LiveData
 * Uses [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) to
 connect views to viewmodels
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection

## Development setup

You require the latest Android Studio 3.1 (or newer) to be able to build the app.
