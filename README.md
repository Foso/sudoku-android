# Sudoku Playground #Ô∏è‚É£  (work-in-progress sample üë∑)

**This is not an official Google product**

Sudoku Playground is a **work-in-progress** sudoku game app for Android and Web (JS).

It's a hobby project to learn about Android APIs, libraries and best practices. It contains a
functional sudoku board generator and solver, as well as UI so that you can actually play a
sudoku board from start to finish. 

At the same time, this app is not meant to showcase the best-in-class sudoku algorithms - 
the ones implemented are _good enough_ for this sample.

## Android development

Some tech you can find inside:

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * The sudoku generator/solver is a pure Kotlin common module, included from the Android
   and JavaScript frontends
 * Uses [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/):
 ViewModels and LiveData
 * Uses [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) to
 connect views to ViewModels (and observes LiveData!)
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection
 * Uses [Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/index.html) to open 
 deep links directly into the app, and also provides an 
 [Instant App](https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/index.html) 
 version from the same project
 
 To showcase the power of Kotlin multiplatform, some additional considerations were made:
 * Sudoku boards are generated using a deterministic algorithm shared between frontends, i.e.
 given a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) initialized with the same seed, 
 you will always get the same board
 * The project contains a seeded PRNG written in Kotlin common (since Kotlin doesn't provide a 
 built-in PRNG for Kotlin/JS in the standard library)
 * Android app supports sharing and opening deep links containing a seed number 
 used to initialize the board (e.g. https://sudokuplayground.firebaseapp.com/sudoku/1234)
 * The website counterpart to the Android app is hosted under the same URLs and will show the 
 same board when opened in a web browser, thanks to the shared, deterministic algorithm
 
## Development setup

You require the latest Android Studio 3.1 (or newer) to be able to build the app.
